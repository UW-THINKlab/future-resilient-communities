                                When a disaster strikes, communities often become isolated, and citizens come together
                                to help each other: people share resources, pass along information, and take on tasks
                                that are outside their usual comfort zone. Some examples include <a

                                These peer-to-peer resource sharing activities fill important gaps during times of
                                disaster that cannot be fulfilled by emergency response agencies. This project helps
                                fill this gap by working closely with two very different communities in Washington State
                                (<b>Westport</b>, WA and Seattle's <b>Laurelhurst</b> neighborhood). This will help us
                                to understand how different people and communities share information and resources
                                during disasters, and how they work together to become more resilient during the
                                challenges of daily life.

                                Our project brings together different ways of learning about disaster resilience in
                                communities. This includes surveys, community design workshops, and building new
                                technologies. The community members we are working with will be “co-designing” with us,
                                ensuring that what we create works well in its specific setting. Community design
                                workshops will bring together people living in the community to discuss issues that are
                                important to them and how technology could help them meet their needs during challenging
                                situations. As we learn more about these needs, we can get better at creating tools to
                                meet them.

                                We are working to build and install rugged “off-grid” hardware, like Wi-Fi access
                                points, that people can use when normal infrastructure might become less reliable. We
                                also hope to create information technologies, like smartphone applications, that can
                                support community resilience in a variety of ways. We hope to use what we learn from the
                                project to develop and pilot test new applications that can potentially be useful in
                                other communities as well.
