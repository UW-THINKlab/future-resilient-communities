                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>The Future Resilient Communities Research Project is a multi-disciplinary research project 
                    funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Smart and Connected Communities (S&CC) program. 
                    The project aims to develop a novel framework for enhancing the resilience of communities to 
                    natural and human-made disasters through the integration of advanced communication technologies, 
                    data analytics, and community engagement.</p>

        <h2>Research Team</h2>
        <p>The project brings together a diverse team of researchers from the fields of civil and industrial engineering, computer science, 
            and social sciences to address the complex challenges of building resilient communities in the face of increasing disaster risks. 
            The research team is collaborating with local communities to co-develop and implement innovative solutions that 
            leverage the latest advances in technology and data science to enhance community resilience.</p>
        <p>This project foundationally integrates social, technical and community partners by engaging all of them in all 
            phases of the work.The research project proposes 4 thrusts (
            <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="#thrust1">Thrust 1</span>, 
            <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="#thrust2">Thrust 2</span>, 
            <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="#thrust3">Thrust 3</span>, and 
            <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="#thrust4">Thrust 4</span>.) 
            to answer various research questions, and each thrust will be led by 
            one or two PI/Co-PI(s) on the team and will engage all team members.
