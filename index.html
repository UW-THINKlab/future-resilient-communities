                <p>The Future Resilient Communities Research Project is a multi-disciplinary research project 
                    funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Smart and Connected Communities (S&CC) program. 
                    The project aims to develop a novel framework for enhancing the resilience of communities to 
                    natural and human-made disasters through the integration of advanced communication technologies, 
                    data analytics, and community engagement.</p>

        <h2>Research Team</h2>
        <p>The project brings together a diverse team of researchers from the fields of civil and industrial engineering, computer science, 
            and social sciences to address the complex challenges of building resilient communities in the face of increasing disaster risks. 
            The research team is collaborating with local communities to co-develop and implement innovative solutions that 
            leverage the latest advances in technology and data science to enhance community resilience.</p>
        <p>This project foundationally integrates social, technical and community partners by engaging all of them in all 
            phases of the work.The research project proposes 4 thrusts (
            <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="#thrust1">Thrust 1</span>, 
            <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="#thrust2">Thrust 2</span>,

            <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="#thrust4">Thrust 4</span>.) 
            to answer various research questions, and each thrust will be led by 
            one or two PI/Co-PI(s) on the team and will engage all team members.

            <div class="event-box">In 2016, Cynthia Chen and Dan Abramson began to develop a collaborative interest in researching 
                social-technical systems resilience at the community scale as it might become expressed in a major disruption to communications and transportation. 
                Cynthia had been working on disaster resilience by both developing novel resilience indices with big data and modeling the failure propagation process 
                on interdependent infrastructure systems. Dan had been working both internationally and locally for ten years on earthquake and tsunami recovery 
                and hazards mitigation planning. The two felt that a community-based focus was important. They undertook to co-advise an incoming PhD student in 
                Urban Design and Planning, Katherine Idziorek, to work on this topic with them. With degrees in both architectural and urban design and planning, 
                and 8 years of professional practice in community engagement for urban design and transportation projects, Katie was well-qualified to contribute to this work.</div>

                approached Cynthia, with a proposal of having a student from UW to conduct a community-based earthquake preparedness project in Laurelhurst. 
                Cynthia approached Dan and Katie about the idea, and they met with John to discuss how their research and professional experience might serve the Laurelhurst effort.</div>

                when Katie finished her dissertation. and supported her to conduct household surveys on attitudes towards local resource and information sharing given social relationships 
                and disruptions to transportation. With TOMNET funding, 2017 is the first year that our focus on community-based peer-to-peer resource and information sharing started. </div>

                evacuation structure. The successful proposal supported the mounting of an applied practical planning studio course and community workshops to explore the need for and potential
